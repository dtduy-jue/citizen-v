# CitizenV Backend
I tried to develop a backend in SpringBoot in 2 weeks during Lunar New Year vacation while my friends go everywhere.<br>
I struggled and lost my last hope when implementing SpringBoot Security to this.<br>
Row filtering, Authentication, Authorization, etc... I wanna study more.<br>
Update: Now I have a collab with <a href="https://github.com/pmm-quang">this guy</a> to finish the mess I started.<br>
